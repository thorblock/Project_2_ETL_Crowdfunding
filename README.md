# Project_2_ETL_Crowdfunding
Pair programming to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data.

## Category and subcategory data frame creation
Category and subcategory data frames are created by string splitting category & sub-category from initial crowdfunding Excel. Category and subcategory IDs are assigned sequentially in order of first appearance.
## Campaign data frame

## Contacts data frame
We went the pandas route for string splitting and data frame creation. 
## Crowdfunding database

## SQL
we used QuickDB to create an ERD of our 4 tables (see QuickDB schema Diagram)
After that, we imported the four tables mentioned thus far into a postgre SQL database based on the afformentioned ERD
